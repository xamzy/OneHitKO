# OneHitKO
A One Hit KO mod for Bully: Scholarship Edition PC

This mod has a public release and is considered completed! 
Fixes and patches to it may be added in future should anything be discovered to be bugging out! 
Gym is Burning softlocked previously, so we have disabled the script for that mission. 

23/08/21 - I am currently working on an updated version of OHKO, which will include fall damage. However am running into issues regarding authority. 
Whenever I have the brain capacity to figure out why it's going wrong, I will update the code. For now I'm going to comment everything so it makes sense to people who don't code and are interested in how it works :)


# Damage Determinations:
i.     Being Hit, Kicked, or grappled by a Ped.

ii.    Being Shot with a Projectile.

iii.   Crashing into a wall with a bike.

iv.    Being hit by ambient weapons.

v.     Shooting someone with a slingshot while in close blowback distance.


# Damage Ignorations:
i.     Crashing into a wall with a Skateboard.

ii.    Being grappled by authority.

iii.   Fall Damage.
