# OneHitKO
A One Hit KO mod for Bully: Scholarship Edition PC


This mod is currently in Beta, and is intended for a small group of Bully Speedrunners to be my guinea pigs in testing. 

It will be updated frequently as I make optimisations.
Luckily, something like this is very easy and very simple. 

The mod is probably 80% how I want it right now... still the code is available for anyone who wants to look at how my brain approaches LUA.
